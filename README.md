# **Climate Prediction Project 1**  
### *Hurricanes, Climate, and Clustering*  

This repository contains **Group 6's Project 1**, focused on analyzing hurricane features and exploring clustering methods. All code implementation and explanations can be found in Project1_final_codeAC.ipynb.

## **Project Objectives and Workflow**  
1. **Feature Selection & Analysis**  
   - Utilize linear regression and machine learning methods to identify key hurricane features based on **PDI (Power Dissipation Index)**.  

2. **Clustering Approaches**  
   - Apply and compare various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, agglomerative clustering, spectral clustering, and BIRCH clustering

3. **Cluster Evaluation & Visualization**  
   - Assess clustering performance using SSD (sum of squared distances) and Sihouette Score 
   - Visualize the resulting clusters for interpretability and insights
