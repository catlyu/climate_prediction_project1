# climate_prediction_project1
This is group 6's project 1 on the topic of "Hurricanes, Climate and Clustering"
The steps and objectives of the project:
- Using machine learning to determine better clustering proxies (linear & XGBoost Feature Importance). 
- Test clustering proxies and multiple clustering methods (DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture, OPTICS, Spectral, Autoencoder, Self-organizing map). 
- Assess similarities within clusters via other storm characteristics (Severity) e.g. PDI
